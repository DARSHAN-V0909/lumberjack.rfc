## Project Description

A **Raw Material Management System** will be developed to automate and streamline the inventory control process for restaurants. This system will be integrated into a POS environment and designed for real-time tracking of raw material availability and usage.

* **Real-time Inventory Monitoring:**
    * Continuous monitoring of inventory levels.
    * Automated alerts for low stock thresholds to ensure timely restocking.
    * Significant reduction in stock-outs and menu unavailability.

* **Dynamic Menu Item Management:**
    * Manages menu item availability for both dine-in and online platforms.
    * Flags or temporarily disables dependent menu items when a critical raw ingredient level is reached, until replenishment occurs.
    * Prevents customer dissatisfaction due and ensures smoother operational flow.

* **Automated Restocking & Supplier Management:**
    * Restocking schedules planned based on historical consumption data and predictive analytics.
    * Automated notification or suggestion of vendors/suppliers based on configured preferences and lead times.
    * Enables a proactive rather than reactive inventory strategy.

* **Detailed Raw Material Tracking:**
    * Categorization of all raw materials.
    * Unit-wise tracking implemented (e.g., kilograms, liters, packets).
    * Wastage tracking and generation of variance reports to identify discrepancies and improve purchasing decisions.

* **Operational Benefits:**
    * Enhances overall kitchen efficiency.
    * Minimizes human error in inventory management.
    * Achieves better cost control.
